      This is my second paragraph. I just got this off the CCHS website. This
      course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer
      science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can
      impact the world. Students work in teams to create apps for mobile
      devices. They explore the impact of computing in society and build skills
      in digital citizenship and cybersecurity. Beyond learning the fundamentals
      of programming, students build computational-thinking skills by applying
      computer science to collaboration tools, modeling and simulation, and data
      analysis. In addition, students transfer the understanding of programming
      gained in App Inventor to textbased programming in PythonÂ® and apply their
      knowledge to create algorithms for games of chance and strategy.
