      This is my second paragraph. I just got this off the CCHS website. This
      course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer
      science and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can
      impact the world. Students work in teams to create apps for mobile
      devices. <b>I can use b to make things bold.</b> They explore the impact
      of computing in society and build skills in digital citizenship and
      cybersecurity.
      <strong
        >I can also use strong to make things bold. But strong has other uses
        that we will talk about later.</strong
      >
      Beyond learning the fundamentals of programming, students build
      computational-thinking skills by applying computer science to
      collaboration tools, modeling and simulation, and data analysis.

      <i>I can use i to make things italics</i>
      In addition, students transfer the understanding of programming gained in
      <em> We can use em or emphasize to make italics</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      and apply their knowledge to create algorithms for games of chance and
      strategy.

    <p>Lets make a list of the best icecream flavors:</p>
    <!-- we can use <ol><li></li></ol> to make ordered lists -->
    <ol>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
      <li>Vanilla</li>
      <li>Strawberry</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- we can use <ul><li></li></ul> to make unordered lists -->
    <ul>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
      <li>Vanilla</li>
      <li>Strawberry</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lets add some images</p>
    <!-- src is the source of the image. Where is it? -->
    <!-- alt is the info about the image. Helps search engines know what it is. 
      Also for bling people or people who use a screen reader
      Alt is also what is displayed when the browser can't find the image -->
    <!-- you can also set the width and the height. Be careful with distorting the image. 
      You can just use the atribute that is most important to you. -->

    <h3>This is some info about the banana</h3>
    <p>
      A banana is an elongated, edible fruit botanically a berry produced by
      several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In
      some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
      distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size,
      color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh
      rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red,
      purple, or brown when ripe.
