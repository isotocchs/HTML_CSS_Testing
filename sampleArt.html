          Technologies are artifacts made through a systematic application of
          knowledge and used to reach practical goals. They are widely used in
          medicine, science, industry, communication, transportation, and daily
          life. Technologies include physical objects like utensils or machines,
          as well as intangible tools like software. Many technological
          advancements have led to societal changes. The earliest known
          technology is the stone tool, used in the prehistoric era, followed by
          fire use, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the
          development of language in the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in
          the Bronze Age enabled wider travel and the creation of more complex
          machines.

          Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the
          telephone, and the Internet have lowered communication barriers and
          ushered in the knowledge economy. While technology contributes to
          economic development and human prosperity, it can also have negative
          impacts like pollution or resource depletion, or cause social harms
          like technological unemployment caused by automation. As a result,
          philosophical and political debates have arisen over the role and use
          of technology, the ethics of technology, and the mitigation of
          technology's potential downsides. Historical and contemporary
          movements like neo-Luddism and anarcho-primitivism criticize
          technology's pervasiveness, while adherents to transhumanism and
          techno-progressivism actively support technological change, viewing it
          as emancipatory. Many negative impacts of technology can be mitigated
          through technological innovations like renewable energy in
          transportation and industry, genetically modified crops to address
          soil depletion, and space exploration to mitigate global catastrophic
          risks.
